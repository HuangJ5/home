		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
		<p>&ldquo;Cats or dogs?&rdquo; A question we&rsquo;ve all heard before. When asked, Some people might say cats while others will say dogs, and given the person, they might like both, or none at all. Which brings us to wonder what the actual answer is to this question. However, don&rsquo;t worry, because the search is finally over. As a matter of fact, cats are more superior than dogs. It is not just a matter of opinion, as there are many reasons that can prove this statement. You do not have to take cats outdoors regularly and they do not need much attention, which is preferred for people who can’t constantly look over their pets. Taking care of cats is also much easier than taking care of dogs when we are talking about convenience. Not only that, but another important factor you need to take into consideration when adopting a pet is money. Owning a cat has been proven to be more affordable than owning a dog. This is actually a huge benefit for people, since money is usually what holds us back when we are buying the things we want. Thus comes the fact that cats are better than dogs.</p>

		<h2>Enough time?</h2>
		<p>Life can be difficult, many people are busy and don&rsquo;t have a lot of time in their schedules to give attention to pets. Even so, countless people fancy the thought of owning an animal. In this case, a cat would be best suitable, because cats are perfectly content staying indoors and if well trained, can even be left alone in the house. While with dogs, they require constant walks and they enjoy being outside, which may be difficult for people busy enough as they are. Maybe in the beginning, you will be able to find some time to go out with your dog, but as time passes, most people will slowly start losing motivation. Although, with cats, you would not have to worry about this since they don&rsquo;t require walks, nor do they really want to be outside. Additionally, cats are more independent so they won&rsquo;t crave for constant attention like dogs do, but it&rsquo;s still good to give them some love every now and then. If you ever actually WANT to play with your cat, they probably would not dislike that either.</p>

		<h2>Enough motivation?</h2>
		<p>Adopting a pet isn’t all what people think of it, they expect to just have to play with them and occasionally change or get their necessities. Sorry to break it to you, but it is not going to be that simple and easy. Taking care of an animal takes time, effort, and the proper mindset. Which you might have at first, but eventually it will start to get tiring, when you have to constantly do the same things over and over again, possibly for years to come. This is when people start losing their proper mindset, imagine having to take a dog out for a walk every single day and you won&rsquo;t even know how long the walk will be. This leads us to another benefit of cats since they are easier to take care of than dogs. Cats are self-cleaning and don&rsquo;t need baths, unlike dogs who need baths regularly so they don&rsquo;t catch any infections or fleas. Cleaning litter boxes is also more convenient than going for walks because it is faster, and in the end, you won&rsquo;t have to take walks late at night, on hot summer days, or through freezing snow. Of course owning a cat does still take effort, but you have to remember that you are taking care of a live being, who will die without proper care. Also, if you truly value your cat, all that effort won’t be for nothing.</p>

		<h2>Enough money?</h2>
		<p>Lastly, something very important in everyone’s lives … money! People might say, &ldquo;mo money, no problems&rdquo;, but at the end of the day, money is what gives us freedom and choices. It allows you to obtain more than just basic needs, yet as well as the things we want, and our life goals. If you are thinking of adopting a pet, a cat would be best in terms of budget. Cats are more affordable than dogs because dogs tend to require more toys and supplies such as leashes, collars, carriers, and more. Adoption fees, medical bills, food, and many other things are generally more expensive for dogs, particularly because most dogs are larger and need more attention. Dogs also have a tendency to wreck their toys more often, so they have to be made from more durable and expensive materials, or be replaced often. Like it is written above, cats don&rsquo;t need to take baths since they clean themselves, while you need to take dogs to the groomers to get a bath, which could be expensive. If you decide to wash your dog by yourself, it could still end up increasing your water bills by quite a bit. Therefore, if you are looking for a pet that will cost less to take care of, a cat is the right choice for you.</p>

		<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
		<p>Cats have many more benefits compared to dogs. Including the fact that you don&rsquo;t need to take cats outside and they are content indoors. Taking care of them is a lot easier and affordable too, which is usually what many people want when looking for a pet. Disregarding all that, cats are overall just lovable and fun creatures to be around. From these reasons, we can clearly conclude, which animal is the better pet. Hence, the question whose answer remained unknown for many years has finally been revealed.</p>
